# Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles, have fun.

## Getting Started

Just clone the repository or get a zip and copy the files to your home directory (~/ for linux users).

### Prerequisites

You're going to need the programs the dotfiles interact with. I recommend looking them up and following their instructions, I use Arch Linux so the links are to that wiki.   
   
The .pacman_packages are packages that I installed through pacman(Arch Linux package manager), but some were obtained through AUR (that's what yay helps with).   
The .pip_packages are the packages I installed through python's pip.

Compositor- [Wayland](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/wayland)   
Windows Manager- [Sway](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Sway)   
Terminal- [Termite](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Termite)   
Shell- [Zsh](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Zsh)   
Text Editor- [Emacs](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Emacs)   

### Installing

Just clone the repository or get a zip and copy the files to your home directory (~/ for linux users).

## Running the tests

If you're system doesn't explode you succeeded. I guess the test is if you're going to buy a new computer or not.

### Troubleshooting
If your terminal is all funky take a gander at [Powerlevel9k](https://github.com/bhilburn/powerlevel9k), it probably has to do with an undownloaded font (I prefer the nerd fonts).
